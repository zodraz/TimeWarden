  <description>As an agent responsible for managing employee holidays, time off, and sick leaves, your tasks include checking these requests against an agile SCRUM project. The system automatically approves requests if there are no date conflicts, the project's story points don't fall below a certain threshold, and the employee has enough available time. If any conflicts arise, or if approval isn't clear-cut, the project manager is prompted to make a decision.</description>
